Weâ€™d like to update the requirements for searching for rates. Rather than a rate needing to encompass the full search period, we can return a valid rate as long as the start time and end time each fall within a rate period. If the start and end times fall within different rate periods, the rate prices are summed together and returned to the user.

Configured Rates
12pm-5pm: $10
5pm-9pm: $5
10pm-11pm: $9

Example Searches
1pm-3pm: $10
10am-1pm: unavailable
1pm-8pm: $15
9am-11am: unavailable
5pm-11pm: unavailable
